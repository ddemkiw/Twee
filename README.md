Twee
=======================

## Synopsis

This is an mvp of a larger idea that explores the rate of information dissemination through the use of social media. 

The idea is to build our own tower of Babel using real time information from the twitter API. 

In it's current instantiation, our app can pull tweets based on the top five trends and our browser can read those tweets using the voice api built into the browser. 

We would like to expand this idea and have multiple voices reading multiple different tweets simultaneously, in different languages.
