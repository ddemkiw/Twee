Twee
=======================

## Synopsis

This is an mvp of a larger idea that explores the rate of information dissemination through the use of social media. 

The idea is to build our own tower of Babel using real time information from the twitter API. 

In it's current instantiation, our app can pull tweets based on the top five trends in London, and we read those tweets using the voice api built into the browser. 

We would like to expand this idea and have multiple voices simultaneously reading multiple different tweets in different languages.

## Takeaway

As a team, this was our first experience working with an API of any kind. It was also our first opportunity designing a project where we could decide for ourselves which technologies to use (in terms of the text-to-speech API). We discovered that and initial code spike is integral for this process, as it gave us the opportunity to experiment with different approaches and different technologies. Once we had a successful spike, it gave us the confidence to build a fully tested mvp.
